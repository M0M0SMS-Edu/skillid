Team Domino's Badge Designer

## Elevator pitch

For various reasons (correspondence between different Nations, easiness of testing, ...) skills are taking over diplomas job. The question is how do we verify that people have the skills, as requiring everyone to send dozens if not hundreds of proofs (each with their own particular data model), one for each skills is not viable. As to simplify the whole thing, Mozzila made a standard, that is called Open Badge. Now there still exist a problem with that standard, it's that it's relatively complex of to use as is, require an image (which require a designer) and is not standardized (someone might give a skill for punctuality, another for arriving on time, ...). As to solve this problem, and make it possible for the layman to give badges, we are building a badge generator linked to ESCO, which is an European standard for skills.
