Team Domino's Badge Designer


## Project context
Our project is about OpenBadges. What are OpenBadges? These are virtual badges, which are used to endorse someone’s skills. For instance, you work at HR and want to endorse an employee’s skill, that holds value and is recognizable. I’ll suggest you to use a badge. Cool, but how can you build a badge if you are not a designer? And that’s our project: We are creating an easy-to-use badge builder, to help companies to endorse employee’s skills.

In order to create a valuable and reliable badge we are using the ESCO standard for naming skills which is represented in the visual part. For the structure we rely on OpenBadges.

To build a badge, the builder just needs the user to enter some basic data, select the skill with our ESCO search field and press Enter. And that’s it. Of course, as a company, you can add your brand to the badge, with your colors and logo.

It looks easy ? This is our promise : an easy-to-use badge builder.
